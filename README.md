# Module-17-Homework-Social-Network-API

## Description

This is an API built from scratch for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. This is a homework assignment for the web development bootcamp sponsored by UNC Chapel Hill.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your system, then run npm run build to make a dist, npm run seed to seed the database, then npm run start to start the server. You can then test the GET routes for yourself using cURL request, Postman, or Insomnia.

## Usage

With Node.js installed, you will run the application using your terminal.

## Credits

My Teacher Assistant, Jalen Straka, provided me with code for my dateformat.ts located in "././utils/dateformat.ts".
